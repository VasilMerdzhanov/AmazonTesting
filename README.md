# Amazon
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##zetta folder contains a project that has 2 classes corresponding to the first two tasks:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Class AmazonTest - Acceptance criteria implementation
2. Class AmazonCrawler - Simple Site Crawl 

And also in the Zetta folder is located a list of all department links in this file <timestamp>_results.txt.

In this case, I used IntelliJ IDEA to solve the first 2 tasks of the assignment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##The API Test folder contains two ways to access the collection where the API testing task is solved:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Json file
2. Via API share.txt file - in which is located Collection Access Key endpoint

I used Postman through the browser to do the tests.
